# System Patterns

- Hybrid RAG + Multi-Agent orchestration
- Specialized agents: Designer, Optimizer, Validator, Educational
- Tool-augmented reasoning with compile/simulate tools in-loop
- Knowledge base: curated Cirq snippets, NL descriptions, explanations
- TensorFlow GPU optimization for neural network operations
- Evaluation: syntax correctness, execution success, educational ratings

Future enhancement (post-project):
- QCanvas integration: real-time circuit visualization and execution
