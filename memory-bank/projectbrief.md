# Project Brief

Cirq-RAG-Code-Assistant is a research-grade system to generate and explain Cirq quantum computing code using a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) + Multi-Agent architecture, with tool augmentation and agentic reinforcement learning.

Core goals:
- Generate syntactically correct, executable Cirq code from natural language
- Provide step-by-step educational explanations
- Optimize circuits (depth, two-qubit gates) via agentic RL/tooling
- Validate via simulation and tests
- Establish datasets, metrics, and benchmarks
- Leverage PyTorch CUDA GPU for performance optimization

Future enhancement (post-project):
- QCanvas integration for real-time circuit visualization and execution
