# Product Context

Why: Lower the barrier to Cirq quantum programming by pairing generation with education and validation.

Users:
- Students learning Cirq and quantum algorithms
- Researchers prototyping circuits with correctness checks

Experience:
- Ask in natural language; receive Cirq code with explanations
- Optional optimization and validation
- Templates for VQE, QAOA, teleportation, Grover, QFT
- GPU-accelerated processing with PyTorch CUDA

Future enhancement (post-project):
- QCanvas users integrating with existing quantum simulator
- Real-time integration with QCanvas for circuit visualization
