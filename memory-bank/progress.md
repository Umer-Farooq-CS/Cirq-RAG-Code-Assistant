# Progress

What works:
- Project skeleton and Memory Bank initialized
- Documentation structure focused on core research goals
- PyTorch CUDA GPU configuration in requirements
- Linux Ubuntu development environment setup

Planned:
- RAG pipeline stub with PyTorch embeddings
- Agent interfaces and evaluation harness
- Multi-agent architecture implementation

Future enhancement (post-project):
- QCanvas integration API design
- QCanvas integration implementation

Issues:
- PyTorch CUDA GPU setup needs validation on target hardware
