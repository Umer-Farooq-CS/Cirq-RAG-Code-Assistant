# Outputs Directory

This directory contains all output files generated by the Cirq-RAG-Code-Assistant system.

## 📁 Structure

```
outputs/
├── artifacts/         # Generated code, visualizations, and results
├── logs/              # System and application logs
├── reports/           # Evaluation reports and metrics
└── README.md          # This file
```

## 🎨 Artifacts

The `artifacts/` directory contains:

- **Generated Cirq code files** from the RAG system
- **Circuit visualizations and diagrams** for quantum circuits
- **Model outputs and predictions** from the multi-agent system
- **Temporary files and intermediate results** from processing
- **Visualization exports** (PNG, SVG, PDF formats)

## 📊 Reports

The `reports/` directory contains:

- **Evaluation reports and metrics** from system testing
- **Performance benchmarks** and timing analysis
- **Code quality reports** from static analysis tools
- **Research findings and analysis** from experiments
- **Comparison studies** with baseline methods

## 📝 Logs

The `logs/` directory contains:

- **Application logs** with different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- **Performance logs and metrics** for system monitoring
- **Error logs and stack traces** for debugging
- **Audit logs** for system operations and user interactions
- **PyTorch logs** for GPU utilization and training progress

## ⚙️ System Management

### Automatic Management

- These directories are **automatically created** by the system
- **Log files are rotated** automatically to prevent disk space issues
- **Temporary files are cleaned up** periodically

### File Organization

- **Timestamped files** for easy chronological tracking
- **Structured logging** with consistent formats
- **Compressed archives** for older log files

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Git Configuration

- All files in this directory are **ignored by Git** to prevent large output files from being committed
- **Log files can grow large** over time - monitor disk usage
- **Artifacts may contain sensitive data** - review before sharing

### Maintenance

- **Regular cleanup** of old log files is recommended
- **Archive important reports** before major system updates
- **Monitor disk space** as outputs can accumulate quickly

### Security

- **Review generated code** before using in production
- **Check logs for sensitive information** before sharing
- **Validate artifacts** for correctness and completeness
